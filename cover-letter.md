Dear Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub,

I would like to express my interest in joining the Biohub as a group leader.

I am a final-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. I have conducted research in infectious disease ecology and evolution, and I am currently working on building a system for rational and real-time phenotypic interpretation of viral genomic data. I am very excited by the Biohub's mission to cure, manage and prevent infectious diseases within our lifetime, and I believe that my proposed projects below will bring a strong contribution to that mission.

As a group leader at the Biohub, I envision building a system that combines high throughput experimentation with Bayesian machine learning algorithms to develop a dashboard that will allow front-line outbreak physicians and epidemiologists make rational decisions with genomic sequencing data. My proposed research projects include the following:

**(1) High Throughput Phenotyping of Viruses:** I will leverage established biochemical assays and robotics to systematically phenotype drug resistance of influenza A virus' neuraminidase, with the goal of expanding phenotyping efforts to other viruses. All quantification of the degree of resistance will be done relative to a standardized strain, allowing for data inter-comparability. We will also quantify and model the uncertainty in the measurements, which can be used in downstream Bayesian deep learning.

**(2) Bayesian Deep Learning:** Leveraging the data generated through high throughput viral phenotyping, I will then use Bayesian convolutional neural networks to learn the mapping from protein structure to phenotype. During my PhD, I have implemented an alpha version of the convolutional neural network that interpretably learns known hydrophobic patches in the HIV-1 protease that are predictive of drug resistance. My team and I will further mature the implementation to leverage the modelled uncertainty in the data to produce uncertainty estimates in model weights and final predictions.

These proposed projects are in line with the Biohub's mission to cure, manage and prevent infectious diseases. I foresee my sub-group integrating well with the Infectious Disease Initiative's Rapid Response team, and interfacing strongly with the Vaccines team due to mutual interest in machine learning on protein structures. I have received independent seed money from the Broad Institute to kickstart these ideas, indicating strong community support. While I will use influenza A virus as the proof of principle for these ideas, they are also generalizable across infectious disease agents, and are not restricted to influenza. The group leader position at the the Biohub will provide the necessary platform and funding to make rational phenotypic interpretation of genomic data reality.

I hope to hear back favourably, and would be thrilled to join the Biohub to make the eradication of infectious disease a reality!
