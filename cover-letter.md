I would like to express my interest in joining the Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub (CZB) as a group leader.

I am a final-year PhD candidate in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. I have conducted research in infectious disease ecology and evolution, and I am currently working on building a system for real-time phenotypic interpretation of infectious disease agents.

As a group leader at the CZB, I envision building a system that combines high throughput experimentation with interpretable machine learning algorithms to allow front-line outbreak physicians and epidemiologists make rational decisions with genomic sequencing data. My proposed research projects include the following:

**(1) High Throughput Phenotyping of Viruses:** I will leverage established biochemical assays and robotics to systematically phenotype drug resistance of influenza A virus' neuraminidase. All quantification of the degree of resistance will be done relative to a standardized strain, allowing for inter-comparability. We will also quantify and model the uncertainty in the measurements, which can be used in downstream Bayesian modelling.

**(2) Bayesian Deep Learning:** Leveraging the data generated through high throughput viral phenotyping, I will then use Bayesian convolutional neural networks to learn the mapping from sequence to phenotype. This will leverage the modelled uncertainty in the data to produce uncertainty estimates in model weights and final predictions.
